Logtopus
--------

Logtopus is a powerful logger for node.js

#Usage

```js
    var log = require('logtopus');
    log.setLevel('sys');

    log.warn('My beer is nearly finish!');
```

## Log levels

    debug    development  Logs debugging informations
    info     development  Helpful during development
    res      staging      Logs requests
    req      staging      Logs responses
    sys      production   Logs application states
    warn     production   Logs warnings
    error    production   Logs errors

For example, setting log level to `req` includes these log levels: `req`, `sys`, `warn`, `error` 
Setting log level to `debug` means all log levels will be logged and
log level `error` logs errors only.

Example:

```js
log.setLevel('res');        // To be ignored in this log level
log.debug('Log example:');  // To be ignored in this log level
log.info('This would not be logged');
log.res('POST /account');
log.req('200 OK');
log.sys('Request done!');
log.warn('Request was unauthorized!');
log.error('An error has been occurred!');

// prints

res: POST /account
req: 200 OK
sys: Request done!
warn: Request was unauthorized!
error: An error has been occurred!
```
